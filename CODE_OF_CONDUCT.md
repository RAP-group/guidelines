# Code of Conduct

## Purpose

This document is primarily aimed at graduate students pursuing a PhD or masters degree in Bilingualism/SLA, Linguistics, Psychology and Cognitive Science. If you are an undergraduate, or are joining the lab in some other capacity, let me know if you have questions about how this document applies to you.

This document should be viewed as a tool to initiate discussion during the early stages of the graduate program, with an awareness that the relationship and expectations will evolve with time. The hope is that this agreement clarifies questions that arise in the lab setting and reduces conflict or tension to make everyone’s interactions more enjoyable.

## Responsibilities

### As a graduate student, it is your responsibility to:

- Complete your degree. This includes classroom and laboratory work, which must be conducted at all times with professionalism, 
self-motivation, engagement, scientific curiousity, and high ethical standards.
- Be knowledgeable of the policies, deadlines, and requirements of the graduate program, the graduate school, and the university. 
Comply with all institutional policies, including academic program milestones, laboratory practices, and rules related to 
chemical safety, biosafety, and fieldwork.  
- Work with me to develop a thesis project for your degree. Your degree requires that you produce a coherent body of research 
representing a contribution to your scientific field. Ensure that your research is ultimately proceeding towards this goal.
- Be responsive to advice and constructive criticism. The feedback you get from me, your colleagues, your committee members, 
and your course instructors is intended to improve you. Respect the wisdom of those who have gone before you. 
Provide feedback on my mentoring to you. Not everyone has the same mentoring needs and personalities, so there will inevitably 
be places where my efforts do not line up with your preferences. I am not infallible, but can only make adjustments when I know 
that they are needed. 

### As group leader, my responsibility is to:

- Provide everyone under my supervision an environment that is intellectually stimulating, emotionally supportive, safe, 
and free of harassment. I will enforce a culture governed by collegiality that values differences in personalities and opinions 
(see below for the detailed version of the lab harassment-free policy).
- Be committed to your research project. I will help you design an independent project within the scope of my lab's research 
for your thesis. I will be intellectually committed to your research. This includes helping you to generate experimental and 
theoretical ideas, interpreting and constructively criticizing your data and contextualizing it within a broader context, and 
supporting you in presenting your ideas and results to the scientific community. 
- Ensure that you receive training. I will provide resources and mentorship from both myself and senior lab members so that you 
have the technical skills that you need to accomplish your research.  If the training you need does not fall within the lab’s 
expertise, we shall discuss opportunities for you to receive that training elsewhere, either through collaborations with other 
laboratories or by attending workshops and classes outside of this University.
- Lead by example and facilitate your training in complementary skills needed to be a successful scientist, such as oral and 
written communication, applying for grants, lab management, mentoring, and scientific ethics and professionalism. I will 
encourage you to seek teaching opportunities, even if not required for your degree, include you where appropriate in grant 
writing and manuscript reviews, and provide opportunities for you to mentor junior researchers. I will enforce high standards 
of scientific ethics and professionalism.  
- Help you navigate your graduate program of study. You are responsible for keeping up with deadlines and being knowledgeable 
about requirements for your specific program. However, I am available to help interpret these requirements, select appropriate 
coursework, and select committee members for your oral exams. 
- Help you build your professional social networks, including presenting at scientific meetings. I will also help you to identify and 
apply for travel fellowships to help pay for attending conferences.
- Provide career advice and assist you in finding a position following your graduation. I will give advice and feedback on your 
career goals, and encourage you to explore opportunities both outside and within academia as suits your interests and progress. 

## The RAP Group is committed to a harassment-free policy

We value the participation of every member of our community and want to ensure that every member has an enjoyable and fulfilling 
learning and working experience. Accordingly, everyone who participates in any RAP Group project is expected to show respect and 
courtesy to other members at all time.
To make clear what is expected, I ask all members of the RAP Group to conform to the following Code of Conduct:
Joseph Casillas, as head of the RAP Group, and all lab members, are dedicated to a harassment-free experience for everyone, regardless 
of gender, gender identity and expression, sexual orientation, disability, physical appearance, race, national origin, age or 
religion. We do not tolerate harassment by and/or of members of our community in any form.


## Our Standards

Examples of behavior that contributes to creating a positive environment include:

- Using welcoming and inclusive language
- Being respectful of differing viewpoints and experiences
- Gracefully accepting constructive criticism
- Focusing on what is best for the community
- Showing empathy towards other community members

Examples of unacceptable behavior by participants include:

- The use of sexualized language or imagery and unwelcome sexual attention or advances
- Trolling, insulting/derogatory comments, and personal or political attacks
- Public or private harassment
- Publishing others' private information, such as a physical or electronic address, without explicit permission
- Other conduct which could reasonably be considered inappropriate in a professional setting

## Lab meetings

Lab meetings will occur weekly. Attendance is required and it is imperative that you come prepared. I will notify you of changes to the schedule at least a day in advance. In addition, I will meet individually with graduate students on a weekly basis to discuss progress on top of weekly lab meetings. The timing of these meetings may change depending on projects, pending publications, and your graduate defense. We will address this as needed.

## Lab Documents

It is your responsibility to maintain a detailed, organized, and accurate record of your research. Lab notebooks are lab 
property and therefore must be maintained to a standard where they can be interpreted by others. Any computer code that you 
generate must be properly documented and reproducible. Expect that all of your code will be published alongside manuscripts. 
All raw data, metadata, analyzed data, manuscripts, figures, and coding developed in the lab are required to be available on a 
shared drive and/or cloud. 

## Scope

This Code of Conduct applies both within project spaces and in public spaces when an individual is representing the project or its community. Examples of representing a project or community include using an official project e-mail address, posting via an official social media account, or acting as an appointed representative at an online or offline event. Representation of a project may be further defined and clarified by project maintainers.
